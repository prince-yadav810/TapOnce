## 5. Technical Constraints

### 5.1 NFC Hardware Limitations

**NTAG216 Chip Specifications:**
- **Total Memory:** 888 bytes
- **Usable Memory (for URL):** ~868 bytes
- **Data Structure:** NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) message containing a URL record

**URL Length Constraints:**
- Maximum URL length: ~850 characters (theoretical)
- Practical limit: Keep URLs under 100 characters for reliability
- **Recommended URL Format:** `yourplatform.com/[username]` (30-50 chars typical)

**Implications for Platform:**
- URLs must be SHORT (cannot store full profile data on chip)
- URL is READ-ONLY after writing (cannot be updated remotely)
- One URL per card (cannot store multiple records)
- Must use web-based profile (chip only stores pointer to web page)

**URL Strategy:**
```
Format: https://yourplatform.com/[slug]

Examples:
- yourplatform.com/rahul-verma (personal name)
- yourplatform.com/tech-solutions (company name)
- yourplatform.com/c/ABC123 (fallback: Card ID)

Length: 30-60 characters typical
```

### 5.2 Mobile Network Constraints (India)

**Target Performance:**
- Page load on 3G: <3 seconds
- Page load on 4G: <1.5 seconds
- Page load on WiFi: <1 second

**Optimization Requirements:**
- Compress all images (WebP format, <100KB per image)
- Minify HTML/CSS/JS
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement aggressive browser caching
- Lazy-load non-critical content

### 5.3 Browser Compatibility

**Must Support:**
- Chrome (Android) - 80%+ of taps expected
- Safari (iOS) - 15%+ of taps expected
- Samsung Internet (Samsung devices)
- Firefox, Edge (minimal but possible)

**Compatibility Requirements:**
- NFC tap must work on all Android 5.0+ devices
- iOS 13+ (iPhone XR and newer for background NFC reading)
- Fallback: QR code for devices without NFC

### 5.4 Device Constraints

**NFC Writing Hardware (Admin Side):**
- USB NFC writer device (e.g., ACR122U, PN532)
- Manual writing process: Admin copies URL → writes to card using NFC writer software
- Batch writing not feasible (manual process per card)

**Customer Devices (Tap Side):**
- No app installation required (browser-based experience)
- Works on locked screen (Android) or requires app open (iOS 13-14) or background tap (iOS 14.5+)
